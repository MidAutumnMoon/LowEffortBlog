# Background Knowledge

[RPG Maker MV and MZ](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) are game engines and development tools specialized for creating eastern style RPG games. The names will be abbreviated as MV and MZ through the post.

MZ is the successor of MV. One way to remember their relationship is that "Z" is after "V" on alphabet, thus MZ is after MV.

On the game editor side, MZ made a lot of quality of life improvements comparing to MV. However, on the engine side, they use the same tech-stack with really minor differences. This makes some tricks able to apply to both engines.

MV and MZ thank goodness runs entirely on the Web stack, because their predecessors are truly some i18n and performance pitfall.

The engine itself is written in JavaScript, the renderer is [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/), and the published game is bundled with [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/) which is just $${\tiny horribly\ outdated}$$ Chromium+Node.js.

This post will focus on the modification on the engine side, which means modifying the published game.
