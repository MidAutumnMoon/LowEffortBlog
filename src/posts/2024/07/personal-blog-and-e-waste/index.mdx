# Ranting Time

This blog is built using [Lume](//lume.land/) static site generator, which is written in TypeScript and runs on [Deno](//deno.land), which not only means countless JavaScript libraries is right on the fingertip to be called, but also, unfortunately, the user and maintainer, have to swallow the bitterness comes out of it.

The very first rant on this project would be how awful Deno's dependency management is. It's like newbie wild survivor packs 500mL of juice instead of 1L of water happily thinking this move not only reduces the weight but also carry extra sugar. *Import map* helps a lot, but it immediately got beaten to the ground by the fact that Deno has no official tool of upgrading dependencies, despite it has been actively developed for almost *10 years*.

The second rant and main concern is, will this project become another [e-waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste)?

One type of e-waste is device that is perfectly fine but abandoned due to reasons like not having enough processing power or simply not fun to play with anymore. That would also be the worst future of this blog.

JavaScript is a poor language that hasn't aged well, and the its dependency ecosystem is straight up garbage in terms of manageability and security. Developers praise for "velocity", praise for the unrestricted ability to pull in dependencies, but the tax of having such freedom isn't noted anywhere.

The feeling of reading and writing clean code is good, and the feeling of having clear overview of dataflow in project is the greatest pleasure. JavaScript with its ecosystem offers none of those. Ah, [*Motivation is Dead*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCBF_XSFmng).

The fact this blog is built on top of such a foundation makes me uneasy. If `$life` takes a lot of time from me, keeping me from gardening my JavaScript for months, will it still build? Or worse, is the motivation still there for me to re-pickup the JavaScript garbage? Is it really, the right choice to do my blog in such way? Let's find out in the future.

Some nice minimalistic text based blog (and platform) for reference:

The remaining of the post will be notes for things learnt from building this blog, also serve as a playground for testing styling and custom features.


# Typography

There's no article without paragraphs, pay some attention to them and the reading experience will level up instantly.

## Max Width

Some study says x characters wide is best and another says y percent is better. I'm comfortable with `70ch` so that's it.

## `lang` Attribute

Every HTMLer learnt to write `<html lang="en">` at some point and never gives it another thought ever again.

This may not be relevant for English that much since the characters and punctuations are relatively simple, but the problem unveils itself once someone reaches out for Asian languages. See this demonstration[^btw].

[^btw]: BTW, just FYI, these two pictures have <i>slightly</i> different heights causing a <i>tiny</i> misalignment.

<div class="flex flex-row w-full gap-4">
    <figure class="grow">
        <img src="./lang-ja.avif" alt="lang-ja.avif" class="w-full" />
        <figcaption lang="ja">Japanese「“关复门”」</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="grow">
        <img src="./lang-cn.avif" alt="span lang=cn" class="w-full" />
        <figcaption lang="zh">Chinese「“关复门”」</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

These two phrases have same characters, but the left one is attributed with `lang="ja"` while the right one is `lang="zh"`, making the browser render them using Japanese and Chinese fonts correspondingly.

This is well-known phenomena caused by the diverged definition of writing and hinting of the same grapheme in different languages, which may result in *really really* ugly typography if mixed up.

Another pitfall learnt fresh while building this website is that `system-ui` or `ui-*` shouldn't be used in font family if i18n is still a concern. Check out this post [*Never, ever use system-ui as the value of font-family*](//infinnie.github.io/blog/2017/systemui.html) for the reasoning behind it, and see a picture of what the experience of reading Chinese characters looks like, back to the low-DPI-screen-Windows-XP/7 era.


# Layout

This part talks about some layout issues.

## Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

*web.dev* has an [excellent article](//web.dev/articles/cls) discussing CLS, so no need to repeat the words here.

To combat CLS while keeping the effort low, this website *1)* doesn't do complex layout, *2)* doesn't use webfonts, *3)* uses a Lume plugin to add `height` and `width` to `<img>`s. It ends up pretty well.

## Unintentional Horizontal Scroll on Mobile Devices

Ever visited another person's blog on your phone while taking the subway, the page didn't follow your finger, instead maneuvering left and right? This is almost always caused by element overflow, like embedding a video without capping its maximum width.

*Some efforts* were put into this site to ensure elements don't overflow, and pray for Safari to not screw things up once again.


# Headings

My rule of thumb is, headings in online articles should be limited to at most two levels, like `<h1>` with some `<h2>`. Deeply nested headings may cause the reader to lose their sense of structure of the article.

## `<h2>` Heading

### `<h3>` Heading

#### `<h4>` Heading

Styled the same as `<h3>`, since it's very rarely used (on this website).

##### `<h5>` and `<h6>` Headings

Never used so they are not styled, Tailwind Preflight should remove default styles from them.


# Text Styling

This part checks out some basic text styling.

*italic*

**bold**

***bold italian***

`Monospace Code`


# Various Blocks

> Quote of another quote
>
> > Someone somehow said:
> >
> >"Somebody at sometime will inevitably do something
> > somewhat without some meaning"

```
Code block with no language specified.
```

```rust
// highlight.js works well enough (tm)
fn fw() -> ft {
    let fm = f!();
    fm.fq();
    fm
}
```


# All Sorts of Lists

1. Several lists are more lister than others.
2. Often the moon stops orbiting to have a rest.
3. Mocking what other monkeys do is what makes salt to not spoil.
4. Epic examination took place in nyctophobia tunnel.

- W
- H
- A
- T

* G
    * ET
* B
    * ORED

*No sense no problem. It simply makes me feel relaxed.*


# Links and Multimedia Resources

# Formulas and Charts

[rehype-mathjax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-mathjax) is used for adding math support. Formulas are rendered to SVGs during building, no JavaScript or CSS is shipped to client.

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint\frac{f(z)}{z-a}dz
$$

Inline $\LaTeX$ also works.

- An $\yen{10,000}$ test for recently $\xleftarrow{\text{added}}$ `ams` package.

*Charts are not used yet.*

# Github Flavored Markdown

## Footnotes

Footnote[^fn] might be useful[^fn2] in the future[^future]. By the way, footnotes aren't required to be placed at the bottom of article. They can be inserted anywhere and aggregated later on, at least with the Remark plugin this site is using.

[^fn]: *one footnote later*
[^fn2]: *another footnote later*
[^future]: *a future of footnote later*


## Tables

*Not used for now.*


# Sidenotes

*May be really nice to have but it will take some efforts to implement and tweak On TODO list for now.*


# MDX

This section demonstrates some custom components.

## Note, Warning and Caution

Mimic what Github has, ref: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925

<comp.Note>
    Note to you, also to me.
</comp.Note>

<comp.Warn>
    Despite being yellow, it still reads "Note" to a lot of people.
