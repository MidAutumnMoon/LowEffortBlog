This blog is built using [Lume](//lume.land/) static site generator,
which is written in TypeScript and runs on Deno, which in turn means it not only has access to
countless JavaScript libraries, but also unfortunately has to swallow the bitter comes out of it.

The remaining of the post will be playground for testing styling and custom features.


# Basics

There's no article without paragraphs, pay some attention to them and
the reading experience will level up instantly.

Here I document some I have done or would do to this very website.

## `lang` Attribute

Every rookie HTMLer learnt to write `<html lang="en">` at some point
and never gives it another tough ever again.

This may not be that relevant to westerners


# Headings

This is an `<h1>` heading.

Notice that the big bold title at the top is also `<h1>`,
but that's its own component and gets styled separately.

## `<h2>` Heading

A little smaller than `<h1>`, used almost as often as `<h1>`.

### `<h3>` Heading

Smaller than `<h2>`.

#### `<h4>` Heading

Styled the same as H3, since it's very rarely used (on this website).

##### `<h5>` and `<h6>` Headings

Never used so they are not styled, Tailwind Preflight would make
look like normal text.


# Text Styling

This part checks out some basic text styling.

*italic*

**bold**

***bold italian***

`Monospace Code`
