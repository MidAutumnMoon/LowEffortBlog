Play with the newly released [*iOS 18*](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/). Note that this post is not a review and does not cover all new features.


# Control Center

The biggest change in iOS 18 could be the new *Control Center* IMO. Previously only handful of builtin functions like flashlight or stopwatch can be displayed, now the overhauled control center can be totally customized to place supported widgets and has the freedom to rearrange everything. Neat!

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2">
    <comp.Pic
        src="./control_center.avif"
        alt="ios 18 control center"
        caption="Fresh new control center"
    />
    <comp.Pic
        src="./control_center_scrollable.avif"
        alt="ios 18 control center with pages"
        caption="Scrollable pages"
    />
    <comp.Pic
        src="./control_center_edit_mode.avif"
        alt="ios 18 control center in edit mode"
        title="Nice beans"
        caption="Edit mode"
    />
</div>


# Locked and Hidden Apps

Apps can be "locked" such way Face ID is required to open them. This is superior to various apps' builtin lock mechanics because it's **way more** faster and responsive.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2">
    <comp.Pic
        src="./require_face_id.avif"
        alt="ios 18 enable require Face ID"
        caption="Enable &quot;Require Face ID&quot; on Journal app"
    />
    <comp.Pic
        src="./face_id_landing.avif"
        alt="ios 18 locked app landing"
        caption="The landing page"
    />
</div>

Another new feature in the same lane is that apps can be put into a hidden drawer which needs Face ID to show. Not finding many uses for it though.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2">
    <comp.Pic
        src="./hide_app.avif"
        alt="ios 18 hide app"
        caption="Hide app by using the second option"
    />
    <comp.Pic
        src="./hidden_drawer.avif"
        alt="ios 18 hidden app drawer in locked state"
        caption="Drawer for hidden apps (locked)"
    />
    <comp.Pic
        src="./hidden_drawer_unlocked.avif"
        alt="ios 18 hidden app drawer in unlocked state"
        caption="Drawer for hidden apps (unlocked)"
    />
</div>


# Vehicle Motion Cues

[New accessibility feature](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/) that aids vehicle motion sickness. Here's a [demo video](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dcxt65/ios_18_db1_vehicle_motion_cues_in_action/) on Reddit if it hasn't been deleted.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2">
    <comp.Pic
        src="./motion_cue_toggle.avif"
        alt="ios 18 motion cue toggle"
        caption="Options to toggle Vehicle Motion Cues"
    />
    <comp.Pic
        src="./motion_cue_enabled.avif"
        alt="ios 18 motion cue enabled"
        caption="Motion Cues enabled. Notice those dots"
    />
</div>


# Some UI Things

Each page in Settings now has a "summary".

<div class="max-w-[40%]">
    <comp.Pic
        src="./settings_summary.avif"
        alt="ios 18 settings pages with summary"
        caption="Summary on top"
    />
</div>


# Some Apps Things

*Passwords* has its own app now. Time to ditch the bloated Google Authenticator app!

<div class="max-w-[40%]">
    <comp.Pic
        src="./password_app.avif"
        alt="ios 18 passwords app"
        caption="The new Passwords app"
    />
</div>
