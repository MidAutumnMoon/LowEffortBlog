    This post was originally written during the period that the author is obsessed with Roam Research and Logseq, but unfortunately this writing style made the content really difficult to read on phones so was quickly abandoned.

- https://hub.nspawn.org/images/ provides NixOS tarball
    - Has a sane default configuration.nix
        - Has `boot.loader.initScript.enable = true;` (otherwise nspawn won't be able to boot the system)
        - Has `boot.isContainer = true;`
            - Source at `nixos/modules/virtualization/container-config.nix`
            - Disables kernel, documentation, firewall etc.
        - Uses `systemd-networkd`
        - But no `sshd`

- Use `machinectl pull-tar <hub url>` to fetch NixOS tarball
    - To give the new system a nickname `<machinectl cmd> nickname`
    - Delete leftover tarball with `machinectl clean`

- Configure the host side
    - Edit `/etc/systemd/nspawn/nickname.nspawn`
        - Set `Private = no` under `[Network]`(saves a lot of headache)
        - Set `Capability = all` under `[Exec]`(also a time-saver)
            - Optionally set `PrivateUsers = no`
    - Start this container when booting `systemctl enable systemd-nspawn@nickname`

- Start the container `machinectl start nickname`

- Configure the guest NixOS
    - To access the container `machinectl shell root@nickname`
    - Do a channel update or flake update[^update]
    - Edit `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
        - Enable sshd by `services.openssh.enable = true;`
            - Change the port to not conflict with the host's sshd
    - Do a `nixos-rebuild`

[^update]: This is the most tedious part but motivation isn't enough for me to talk about it.

That should be everything.
